## Unsurprising/not new things
1. That there wouldn't be a prescribed method for live coding that could be succintly represented in a single book
    - Since it's live, it's a performance that can contain improvisation and changes
    - Certainly has techniques but there's not just one way to do it
2. The push from tech companies to make imperceptible the barrier between technology and human life
    - Lessening the interaction between the user and the system by making its design more human leads people to be more easily acquainted and drawn to it (like ChatGPT or Amazon Echo)
    - These companies have a vested interest in maintaining the attention and information flow of consumers for as long as possibleâ€”which is trivial if technology is everpresent in their lives

## Surprising/new things
1. Live coders being improvising *composers*
    - Code being the structure and score, while the computer is the performer
2. The concept of temporality in writing and in coding
    - Authors may go through their work and edit it, or add sections non-chronologically
    - So might live coders edit or remove code written earlier in a performance, or insert new code within an existing portion to change its effects
